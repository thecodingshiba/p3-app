# Project 3 â€“ Group 2: Interactive dashboard ECO-POP to explore and analyse Census and GDP data
The aim of our project is to explore the relationship between a country's economic prosperity and the population's health and wellbeing indicators. We will examime the relationships between GPD, population, 
health of population and fertility dates around the world. Out hypothesis is there is a positive correlation between economic prosperity and health and wellbring.
The project team has created and interactive dashboard to allow users to explore census and GPD data.

## How to run the interactive site
- BICH TO WRITE AFTER WE MERGE THE TWO REPOSITORIES 
- Launch a virtual environement
- Run app-solutions.py

## Limitations
- The census data covers the period of 1960 - 2021.
- During the data cleaning process, smaller countries which had did not have conistent GDP and population data for every year was dropped form the set presented
- For ease of navigation, specific sets of certain of health data was selected for the drop down options

## Data Sources
- Population data United Nations Data Portal Population Division <https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/>
- GDP from World Bank data <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD?end=2022&start=1990&view=chart>
- lat & long data from Developers Dataset <https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv>
- Js Library list <https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/>

## Tools

## Ideas for Plots/Tables
- GDP(nominal) Vs Infant mortality rate
- GDP(nominal) per capita Vs Infant mortality rate

## Dashboard stucture
- Headline
- Country info table - 1) Name 2) Sub-region 3) Continent 4) Current population 5) Current GDP(nominal) 6) Current GDP(nominal) per capita
- Dropdown menu 1) Continent 2) Sub-region 3) Country
- Population Vs Year

## Notes:
- Recall our Prokect 1 Ststistical Analysis included a null and alternative hypothesis, outlier analysis, t-test discussions
